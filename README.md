KnowledgeBridge International Style Guides
===================

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([kbi/styleguide](https://github.com/KBIOPS/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for KBI code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at KBI, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.

This project holds the [Java Style Guide][java], [Python Style Guide][py],
[Shell Style Guide][sh], [HTML/CSS Style Guide][htmlcss], and the
[JavaScript Style Guide][js].
